## Using third-party apps

Before you can use third-party apps you need to whitelist them. This feature was introduced in node-solid-server in March 2019, and is due to be activated by the main pod servers some time in 2019. To white-list a third-party app, go to your profile URL (including the '#me' at the end), hover your cursor over the '(your name)' header, and select the 'A' icon.
